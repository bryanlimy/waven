===========================


.. admonition:: Q: Where should I save the video files and other data files?

   A: Save all files locally on your machine. Reading and writing from a server may significantly slow down processing.

.. admonition:: Q: Can I save the Gabor filter library anywhere?

   A: Save the Gabor library locally as well. It can be a large file and should be accessible quickly for efficient processing.

.. admonition:: Q: The wavelet preprocessing step takes a long time. Is that normal?

   A: Yes. The initial preprocessing can be time-consuming. However, once completed, the saved files are reused for future analysis. As long as subsequent experiments use the same video stimulus, the analysis will be much faster.

.. admonition:: Q: What are the minimum hardware requirements?

   A: Make sure your system has **at least 100 GB** of free disk space and **64 GB of RAM** to run the analysis smoothly.
